API_MakeDoc revision 0
----------------------

This set of Python scripts will generate Live API documentation in XML format, based on realtime inspection of the Live module. Compatible with Live 8.1 & higher, on PC or mac. 

To run, first drop the API_LiveDoc folder into Ableton's MIDI Remote Scripts directory:

MAC OS X -> /Applications/Live 8.x OS X/Live.app/Contents/App-Resources/MIDI Remote Scripts/
PC -> C:\Program Files\Ableton\Live 8.x\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts\ 

Next, select "API_MakeDoc" from the MIDI Preferences dialog, then reset immediately to "None" (there is no need to close the dialog first). Two files will be written to the userhome directory: Live.xml and Live.css (sample output is included in the _Sample_Output directory). To locate the userhome directory:

MAC OS X -> click the Home icon in the Finder toolbar
PC -> C:\Documents and Settings\username\

Open Live.xml in a web browser to view the API documentation.
